# Implementation Blueprint

## Agent Context Guide

Open this file when building or modifying screens, routes, page layouts, protected pages, or shared UI components. This is the main implementation map. If you only need types, validation, or service contracts, open the narrower implementation docs instead.

Related files:

- Data types: `docs/implementation/DATA_MODELS.md`
- Validation: `docs/implementation/VALIDATION_RULES.md`
- Services: `docs/implementation/SERVICES_CONTRACTS.md`
- Permissions: `docs/product/ACCESS_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`
- Current task status: `docs/delivery/TASK_BACKLOG.md`

New product screens must keep the current landing visual style: dark background, Solana purple/green accents, dark cards, subtle borders, premium spacing, and responsive layouts.

| `/dashboard/startups/new`               | Logged-in with minimum profile | Create startup draft.                           |
| `/dashboard/startups/[id]/edit`         | Owner only                     | Edit owned startup.                             |
| `/dashboard/startups/[id]/verification` | Owner only                     | Request verification and publish.               |

Template routes like `/case-study` and `/use-case` are not final product routes.
