# Solana Startups Hub

Solana Startups Hub is a curated marketplace directory for startups building in the Solana ecosystem.

The MVP lets founders sign in by signing a message with a Solana wallet, complete a professional profile, list a startup, request verification, publish verified startups, and make them discoverable to logged-in users.

In v1, "marketplace" means structured discovery and founder contact through public social links. It does not include chat, offers, payments, USDC acquisition flows, or deal rooms.

## Current Status

Last audited: 2026-07-13.

- Core product routes are implemented.
- Solana wallet sign-in (SIWS) and SSR-backed Supabase sessions are implemented.
- Profiles and startups are persisted in Supabase/PostgreSQL with RLS and protected RPCs.
- User profile, dashboard, startup CRUD, verification, marketplace, detail page, and founder contact screens exist.
- Product and implementation documentation lives under `docs/`.
- Local seed data and database policy tests are included under `supabase/`.

Current task progress is tracked in [docs/delivery/TASK_BACKLOG.md](docs/delivery/TASK_BACKLOG.md).

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20 or higher.
- npm.
- A Supabase project, or Docker for the local Supabase stack.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. For local Supabase development, start and reset the stack:

```bash
npm run supabase:start
npm run db:reset
```

Use the API URL, publishable key, and service-role key printed by `supabase:start`. For hosted environments, enable the Solana Web3 provider in Supabase Auth and provide the hosted project values instead. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` provisions a profile only after the server verifies the SIWS identity; it also powers the optional development verification endpoint. It must never use a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start the local development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run build:with-docs # Build Docusaurus docs and then the app
npm run docs:dev     # Start Docusaurus locally
npm run docs:build   # Generate static Docusaurus files under public/docs
npm run start        # Start the production server
npm run lint         # Run lint command configured in package.json
npm run lint:fix     # Run lint autofix command configured in package.json
npm run format       # Format files with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check formatting with Prettier
npm test             # Run TypeScript unit tests
npm run db:test      # Run pgTAP RLS/RPC tests (local Supabase required)
```

## Wallet Authentication

The app discovers installed Solana wallets through Wallet Standard and asks the selected wallet to sign Supabase's SIWS challenge. The resulting Supabase session is refreshed by middleware and is the only identity accepted by database policies.

Supported wallets depend on the user's installed Wallet Standard-compatible extensions. No embedded wallet or WalletConnect/Reown account is required.

Verification approval/rejection can be enabled only outside production with both `ENABLE_DEV_VERIFICATION=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_VERIFICATION=true`. This is a development aid, not an admin feature.

## Known Gaps

The product is still mid-MVP. Before release:

- Align all landing copy with v1 messaging.
- Add the missing tech stack filter UI.
- Fix unconditional `IS RAISING` badges.
- Add direct `Save and request verification` flow.
- Add analytics mock.
- Replace development verification with a real reviewer/admin workflow.
- Add hosted-environment and wallet compatibility QA evidence.

## Commit Convention

This project uses task-based commits for product work:

```text
agonzalez/TASK-ID/commit-title
```

Example:

```text
agonzalez/TASK-042/update-readme
```

Use [docs/delivery/TASK_BACKLOG.md](docs/delivery/TASK_BACKLOG.md) to choose the task ID. The helper skill is documented in [skills/create-commit/SKILL.md](skills/create-commit/SKILL.md).
