# Solana Startups Hub

Solana Startups Hub is a curated marketplace directory for startups building in the Solana ecosystem.

The MVP helps founders sign in with a Solana wallet, complete a professional profile, list a startup, request verification, publish verified projects, and make those projects discoverable to logged-in users.

In v1, marketplace means structured discovery and founder contact through public social links. It does not mean chat, offers, payments, USDC acquisition flows, or deal rooms.
