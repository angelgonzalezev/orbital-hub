## Product Summary

Solana Startups Hub is a curated marketplace directory for startups building in the Solana ecosystem.

The MVP lets founders connect a wallet, complete a professional profile, list a startup, request mock verification, publish verified startups, and make them discoverable to logged-in users.

In v1, "marketplace" means structured discovery and founder contact through public social links. It does not include chat, offers, payments, or deal rooms.

## MVP v1 Scope

Included:

- Wallet login or mock wallet login.
- User/founder profile.
- Private dashboard.
- Create, edit, archive, verify, and publish owned startups.
- Protected marketplace of verified and published startups.
- Protected startup detail page.
- Filters by category, stage, tech stack, fundraising, and acquisition status.
- Founder contact through X and Telegram from the startup owner profile.

Out of scope:

- XMTP.
- Anonymous chat.
- Internal contact forms.
- Contact requests.
- Offers.
- USDC payments.
- Deal room.
- Real domain verification.
- Real X API integration.
- Supabase/PostgreSQL.
- Notifications.
- Admin/reviewer dashboard.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Anonymous users can only see the landing page and aggregate/marketing information.
- Startup list, startup cards, filters with real results, startup detail, and founder contact require wallet login.
- A startup appears in marketplace only when `verificationStatus = verified` and `listingStatus = published`.
- Only the owner can edit, archive, request verification, or publish their startup.
- Founder contact v1 is limited to X and Telegram from the `User` associated with `Startup.ownerWallet`.
- `open_to_discuss` means open to acquisition conversations, not a transaction flow.
- Landing copy must not promise `trade startups`, `buy startups`, `USDC acquisitions`, or `deal room` in v1.
